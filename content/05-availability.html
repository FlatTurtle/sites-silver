<p>Highly efficient, flexible floor plates allow for very high density occupation.</p>

<p>Special attention was paid to the flexibility of the office space. The layout of the building and partitions are based on alternating modules of 90 and 180cm, which allows you to get office spaces of 2,70m, 3,60m, 4,50m and 5,40m.</p>

<p>In combination of two different dephts of the wings of the building, the modularity gives you liberty in the layout of your premises and ensures excellent results on work post/m2 locative, in case of both individual offices and open space.</p>
